<aside class="notes" markdown="1">
Programming or writing code is giving a set of instructions for a computer to carry out.  Writing code is a creative process which often involves experimenting with programming languages and exploring the web to discover new things you can make the computer do.  When we say "hacking" we mean playing around with computer code to try to understand how it works and what we can make it do.
